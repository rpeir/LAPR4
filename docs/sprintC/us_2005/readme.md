### 4.3. Applied Patterns

Considering the analysis and design of the previous sections, the team decided to apply the following patterns:
- **Factory Method** - to create the repositories
- **Information Expert** - the exam execution is responsible for the grades of the exams
- **Repository** - to access the data
- **Service** - to implement the business logic in a centralized way to view the grades of a student

### 4.4. Tests

#### 4.4.1. calculateGrade

````
        public void calculateGrade() {
        Assert.assertEquals(10F, examExecution1.calculateGrade(), 0.01);
        Assert.assertNotEquals(5F, examExecution1.calculateGrade(), 0.01);
    }
````

## 5. Implementation
