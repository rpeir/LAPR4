## 4. Common Changes ##

### 4.1. Domain Model ###

![Domain Model](./domainModel.svg)

In this sprint, the domain model was updated. The main changes were:

 - The aggregate "Cell" was renamed to "PostIt" to better represent the domain.
 - The PostIt "Content" value object is now the "Content" used in the Update aggregate.
 - Was added an "undo" state to the Update aggregate root.

## 5.Team Decision ##
- The team decided to address the synchronization issues related to the shared boards by implementing a synchronization object, a singleton class used by all threads in TCP server that is responsible for the synchronization of the operations on the shared boards.
- The team evaluated the scenarios that could be problematic and protected the code with locks to prevent the occurrence of those scenarios.
- Upon the problem of multiple-user access to the TCP server, through the HTTP server, the team decided to implement a session ID to prevent unauthorized access to the server and to control them.
